"LVGMP" is a placeholder name for the Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones (U) ROM hack I'm working on. I cannot guarantee that it will ever reach a playable state. Hopefully it will!

It is built using [my Event Assembler distribution][EA] and makes use of [my fork of the FE8 decompilation][FE8] as reference.
